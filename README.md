# Retail-Store-Performance-through-visualisations
# About:
On a client’s dataset, descriptive statistics are analysed based on the KPI’s of outlets associated with the store, and visualizations are created which can help the client get an understanding of the business. This is achieved through Python. Ran pricing models using statistical tools and understanding the numbers within those models.
# Data:
The dataset given contains three key performance indicators (KPIs) at all the outlets of a retail company. In each variable, a high score is desirable.
# Reasearch scope and visualisations:#How much variation is there between the outlets?
• Are there a few falling behind?
• Are stores that excel in one KPI also, on average, excelling in others?
• Is there a difference in the averages of the other KPIs between the Low, Medium and
High categories?
• What is the uncertainty in those group averages?
